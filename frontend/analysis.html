                <li> With rise of AI and ML, companies are increasingly adopting automation in their models.</li>
                <li> AMT, DCT and CVT stand for Automated Manual Transmission, Dual-Clutch Transmission and Continuously Variable 
                  Transmission respectively. Driving types such as AMT, DCT and CVT indeed have certain advantages which give smooth 
                  driving experience, but it seems either not many people are aware of these types or that since they are on the 
                  expensive side, not many can afford it.</li>
                <li>It also might be that we need to analyse more data in order to form conclusions about people
